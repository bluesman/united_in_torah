                <img src="img/logo.png" class="col-lg-4 speakers">
                <p>"For this is the covenant I will make with the house of Isra'el after those days," says YHVH: "I will put my Torah within them and write it on their hearts; I will be their God, and they will be my people," (Jeremiah 31:33).</p>

                <p>We believe that the whole word is inspired by God and is ALL still applicable today (2 Tim. 3:16). We seek to worship YHVH is spirit and truth (John:4:24).</p>

                <p>We believe that God's word today has been replaced by traditions of men, both by Jew and non-Jew. Yeshua stated the obvious in Mark 7:6-9, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites - as it is written, 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far away from me. Their worship of me is useless, because they teach man-made rules as if they were doctrines.' "You depart from God's commandments and hold onto human tradition, Indeed," he said to them, "you have made a fine art of departing from God's commandments in order to keep your tradition!"</p>
                
                <p>We believe that YHVH is making known His desire in these last days. Jew and non-Jew are beginning to have their 'stoniness' (Rom. 11:25) removed and are repenting of their lawlessness and are discovering what God requires. If this was not so, then why would Yeshua's tell the man at the pools of Bethesda, "See you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you," (John 5:14). We have been taught too much grace with a license to sin. We must make a U-TURN and return to God's ways and say to him, "Our fathers inherited nothing but lies, futile idols, completely useless," (Jer. 16:19).</p>

                <p>We must acknowledge that we have sinned against the Father, repent and accept his only Son as our means of atonement, but we must not return to our old ways. If we believe in the God of Israel, we must walk in His commandments, statutes and ordinances. For Yeshua says, "If you love me, keep my commandments, (John 14:15) for, "I and the father are one (John 10:30).</p>

                <p>Finally, despite whether we are extremely Torah observant or not, "You have been delivered by grace through faith, and even this is not your accomplishment but God's gift. You were not delivered by your own actions: therefore no one should boast," (Eph. 2:8,9). We must remain united in Yeshua the Messiah, if we fail to recognize that our family in Messiah needs us to encourage them to walk in truth we have failed in understanding the whole Torah, for Yeshua quoted the most important part of Torah, "You are to love YHVH your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength and with all your understanding; and your neighbor as yourself," (Luke 10:27). So brethren it would be wise to bring down our loftiness when observing Torah. As a wise king once said, "He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbor: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace," (Prov. 11:12).</p>

                <p>God righteousness is not matched, so let us live our lives imitating our Messiah and let the crowds come to you, by your actions and the Spirit of TRUTH.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>To proclaim Yeshua the Messiah and His will that we would be one as He and the Father are one. Our vision is unite Messianic Jew and non-Jew in one purpose and unity. We are one body in Messiah, the people of Israel and we should put away all divisions among us. That way... All ISRAEL shall be SAVED!</p>

                            <p class="col-lg-12 speaker-bio">"I was raised in the Constantinian (Christian) church since a very young age. Like many of you, as children who grew up in a protestant environment, I went “forward” at the age of 9 and asked Jesus into my heart. Wow have I come full circle!</p>
                            <p class="col-lg-12 speaker-bio">Long story short I have developed in recent years a love for my Creator and a sincere willingness to seek Him in all ways and am eagerly awaiting the return of His Son Yeshua/Jesus. One thing His Word promises to do is to reveal Him and His will to those who seek Him. He has done that for my wife and I in a number of ways once I decided that nothing in this world is worth my attention more than Him.</p>
                            <p class="col-lg-12 speaker-bio">People think I’m crazy and will say that the law is done away with. They argue that Jesus nailed the law to the cross. For every verse you give me that says the law is done away with I can give you 2-3 verses in the NT that says its not. So either we have many contradictions in God’s Word or a misunderstanding spanning generations back to Constantine and the supposed Holy Roman Empire."</p>

He studied music at IAU. For twenty years he was a vocalist in nightclubs, hotels, bars and cruise ships in the United States. In February of 1984, while employed by Walt Disney World, Jonathan had an "Encounter with Eternity." He became a Believer in Yeshua HaMashiach, (Jesus, the Messiah.)</p>
                            <p class="col-lg-12 speaker-bio">He was discipled for six years in a small church in Florida and was one of their worship leaders for their Erev Shabbat Service. In 1990, Jonathan responded to The Lord's call to make "Aliyah" (returned to his homeland, Israel), and moved his family to Jerusalem where he came to love and identify completely with the Israeli culture. In 1990, Settel International Ministries was birthed. After a tremendous growth in Ministry, he and his family then returned to the United States to fulfill the next leg of the journey.</p>

                            <p class="col-lg-12 speaker-bio">Joshua Aaron is an independent Messianic singer/songwriter and ordained minister. He and his wife, Jeannie have four children (Emma, Joshie, Max and Levi) and maintain citizenship with both the nation of Israel & the United States of America. His latest CD release (Nov, 2012), “You Are Holy“ has uniquely connected both the church and Israel through music and recently won an Independent Music Award for the original song “Hoshiana“. Joshua travels in a full time capacity, sharing G-d’s good news through Hebraic worship, powerful testimony and biblical teaching… proclaiming a message of hope in Yeshua (Jesus), a love for the Jewish people and a desire for the return of the Messiah. His connection to the Messianic movement dates back to 1976 when his mother (an Israeli-born Jew) accepted Messiah after hearing a message by the late Marty Chernoff on “the Jewishness of Jesus”. Although being born in the U.S., Joshua’s roots to the modern nation of Israel date back to the 1940′s when his grandmother Ruth Epstein migrated from Germany to the “Promised Land”. It is there were his mother was born (in 1948) and listed as the first adopted Jew in the nation of Israel.</p>

                            <p class="col-lg-12 speaker-bio">Messianic Dance Camps International is a religious Messianic Jewish organization which offers dance camps (workshops) for both Jewish and non-Jewish believers in Yeshua (Hebrew for Jesus) the Messiah of Israel. M.D.C.I. expressly focuses on worshipping Yeshua through Davidic Dancing and fellowship</p>
                            <p class="col-lg-12 speaker-bio">Mindy and Ralph Seta will facilitate the dance instruction and if needed may also include a member of the M.D.C.I. ministry team. Each dance will include spiritual applications, origin, and prayer. Dances will be taught directly from the M.D.C.I. teaching curriculum “Teach Your Feet to Praise the Lord” which we make available for sale at our workshops and on our website. Written dance notations are also provided upon request.</p>
                            <p class="col-lg-12 speaker-bio">"We believe our ministry in general is an outreach to Christian believers who are interested in learning about their Jewish/Hebrew Roots and expressing themselves in the worship of Yeshua through Davidic praise dancing. Our hope is as Paul said in Ephesians, "...that in Himself (Yeshua) He might make the two (Jew and Gentile) into one new man, thus establishing peace." </p>
